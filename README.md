# RobloxStudioRPC
Discord Rich Presence for Roblox Studio.
## Warning
This does not work correctly. Use at your own risk. I do not have any plans to update this.
## Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* Discord desktop client
## Installation
### Windows
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Run install-deps.bat and let the process finish.
4. Run the server using run.bat
5. Open Roblox Studio.
6. Manually copy RobloxStudioRPC.rbxmx into %LocalAppData%\Roblox\Plugins (or wherever your Roblox Studio plugins folder is located)
6. Enjoy!

You need to run the server before and each time you run Roblox Studio for it to work.
